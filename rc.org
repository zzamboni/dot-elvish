* Introduction

This is my main config file for [[http://elvish.io][Elvish]].

This file is written in [[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-programming-tutorial.html][literate programming style]], to make it easy
to explain. See [[file:rc.elv][rc.elv]] for the generated file.

* Paths

First we set up the executable paths. We set the ~GOPATH~ environment
variable while we are at it, since we need to use it as part of the
path.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    E:GOPATH = ~/Personal/devel/go/
    paths = [
      ~/bin
      ~/Dropbox/Personal/devel/hammerspoon/spoon/bin
      ~/.gem/ruby/2.4.0/bin
      /opt/X11/bin
      /Library/TeX/texbin
      /usr/local/opt/node@6/bin
      /usr/local/bin
      /usr/local/sbin
      /usr/bin
      /bin
      /usr/sbin
      /sbin
      $E:GOPATH/bin
    ]
#+END_SRC

* External modules

The bundled [[https://elvish.io/ref/epm.html][epm]] module allows us to install and manage Elvish packages
(for now I'm using a modified version of my own which includes the
=epm:install-if-needed= function I use below).

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use testing/epm
#+END_SRC

Install all my packages, the modules within them get loaded individually
below.

For now I use these packages:

- [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv][zzamboni/modules.elv]] contains all my modules except completions and
  themes. Maybe these should be separated eventually, but for now this
  works fine.
- [[https://github.com/zzamboni/theme.elv][zzamboni/theme.elv]] contains my prompt themes (only [[https://github.com/zzamboni/theme.elv/blob/master/chain.org][chain]] for now).
- [[https://github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv][zzamboni/completer.elv]] contains my completer definitions.
- [[https://github.com/xiaq/edit.elv][xiaq/edit.elv]], which includes the =smart-matcher= module used below.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
  epm:install-if-needed github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv
  epm:install-if-needed github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv
  epm:install-if-needed github.com/zzamboni/theme.elv
  epm:install-if-needed github.com/xiaq/edit.elv
#+END_SRC

* Base modules

Load the bundled [[https://elvish.io/ref/re.html][re]] module for regular expression functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use re
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/prompt_hooks.org][prompt_hooks]] module provides some functions for manipulating the
before/after command hooks.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/prompt_hooks
#+END_SRC

The bundled [[https://elvish.io/ref/bundled.html][readline-binding]] module associates some Emacs-like
keybindings for manipulation of the command line.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use readline-binding
#+END_SRC

I add a couple of keybindings which are missing from the default
=readline-binding= module.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    # Alt-backspace to delete word
    edit:insert:binding[Alt-Backspace] = $edit:kill-small-word-left~
    # Alt-d to delete the word under the cursor
    edit:insert:binding[Alt-d] = { edit:move-dot-right-word; edit:kill-word-left }
#+END_SRC

* Nix package manager

I use the [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] package manager on macOS, the [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/nix.org][nix]] module sets up the
necessary environment variables.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/nix
    nix:multi-user-setup
#+END_SRC

* Git-related stuff

The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv/blob/master/git.org][completer.elv:git]] module provides completions for git and similar
commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv:git
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv/blob/master/vcsh.org][completer.elv:vcsh]] module provides git-like completion for vcsh.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/completer.elv:vcsh
#+END_SRC

* Prompt theme

I use the [[https://github.com/zzamboni/theme.elv/blob/master/chain.org][chain]] prompt theme, ported from the fish theme at
https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-chain.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
  use github.com/zzamboni/theme.elv/chain
  edit:-prompts-max-wait = 0.01
  chain:bold_prompt = $true
  chain:setup
#+END_SRC

* Automatic proxy settings

When I am in the office, I need to use a proxy to access the
Internet. For macOS applications, the proxy is set automatically
using a company-provided PAC file. For the command line variables,
the [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/proxy.org][proxy]] module allows me to define a test which determines when
the proxy should be set, so that the change is done automatically.

First, we load the module and set the proxy. The
=proxy:setup_autoset= function adds the =proxy:autoset= function to
both the pre- and post-command hooks, so that the proxy is
automatically set/unset as soon as possible, even if the conditions
change while I am typing a command.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/proxy
    proxy:host = "http://proxy.corproot.net:8079"
    proxy:setup_autoset
#+END_SRC

Next, we set the test function. In my case, the =/etc/resolv.conf=
file contains the ~corproot.net~ domain (set through DHCP) when I'm in
the corporate network, so I can check for that.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    proxy:test = { and ?(test -f /etc/resolv.conf) ?(egrep -q '^(search|domain).*corproot.net' /etc/resolv.conf) }
#+END_SRC

* Long-running-command notifications

The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/long-running-notifications.org][long-running-notifications]] module allows for producing a
notification when a command takes longer than a certain time to
finish (by default the period is 10 seconds). The module
automatically detects when [[https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier][terminal-notifier]] is available on macOS
and uses it to produce Mac-style notifications, otherwise it prints
a notification on the terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/long-running-notifications
    long-running-notifications:setup
#+END_SRC

* Directory and command navigation and history

Elvish comes with built-in location and command history modes. I use
the new (still experimental) =narrow= module, which allow for more
customization, including pre- and after- hooks for each of the
modes. I use the default binding for history mode (~C-r~), but change
the location mode binding to ~Alt-l~ to avoid conflicting with the binding of
~C-l~ to "clear screen" in =readline-binding=. I disable the
lastcmd binding because it is taken over by the =bang-bang= module
below.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use narrow
    narrow:bind-trigger-keys &location=Alt-l &lastcmd=""
#+END_SRC

I have decades of muscle memory using ~!!~ and ~!$~ to insert the last
command and its last argument, respectively. The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/bang-bang.org][bang-bang]] module
allows me to keep using them.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/bang-bang
    bang-bang:bind-trigger-keys
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/dir.org][dir]] module implements a directory history and some related
functions. I override the built-in ~cd~ command with a function that
calls =dir:cd= so that any directory changes are kept in the
history. I also create a top-level wrapper for the =dir:cdb= function,
which allows changing to the base directory of the argument. The
module also implements a narrow-based directory history chooser,
which I bind to ~Alt-i~.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/dir
    dir:setup
    edit:insert:binding[Alt-b] = $dir:left-word-or-prev-dir~
    edit:insert:binding[Alt-f] = $dir:right-word-or-next-dir~
    edit:insert:binding[Alt-i] = $dir:history-chooser~
    fn cd [@dir]{ dir:cd $@dir }
    fn cdb [@dir]{ dir:cdb $@dir }
#+END_SRC

* Aliases

Elvish does not have built-in alias functionality, but this is
implemented easily using the [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/alias.org][alias]] module, which stores the alias
definitions as functions under =~/.elvish/aliases/= and loads them
automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/alias
#+END_SRC

* Dynamic terminal title

The =set-title= function uses the standard ANSI escape sequence for
setting the terminal title. I add hooks to set the title before and
after each command, so that the terminal title will show the name of
the command being executed or the word ~"elvish"~, followed by the
current path.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    fn set-title [title]{ print "\e]0;"$title"\e\\" }
    prompt_hooks:add-before-readline {
      set-title "elvish "(tilde-abbr $pwd) > /dev/tty
    }
    prompt_hooks:add-after-readline [cmd]{
      set-title (re:split '\s' $cmd | take 1)" "(tilde-abbr $pwd)
    }
#+END_SRC

* Miscellaneous stuff

I use the [[https://atlas.oreilly.com/][O'Reilly Atlas]] publishing platform. The [[https://github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/blob/master/atlas.org][atlas]] module
contains some useful functions for triggering and accessing document
builds.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    use github.com/zzamboni/modules.elv/atlas
#+END_SRC

The =private= module sets up some private settings such as
authentication tokens. This is not on github :)

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    if ?(test -f ~/.elvish/lib/private.elv) { use private }
#+END_SRC

The [[https://github.com/xiaq/edit.elv/blob/master/smart-matcher.elv][smart-matcher]] module tries prefix match, smart-case prefix match,
substring match, smart-case substring match, subsequence match and
smart-case subsequence match automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish :noweb no-export
     use github.com/xiaq/edit.elv/smart-matcher
     edit:-matcher[''] = $smart-matcher:match~
#+END_SRC

Other possible values for =edit:-matcher= are =[p]{ edit:match-prefix
&smart-case $p }= for smart-case completion (if your pattern is
entirely lower case it ignores case, otherwise it's case sensitive).
=&smart-case= can be replaced with =&ignore-case= to make it always
case-insensitive.

Some general environment variables.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    E:LESS = "-i -R"
    E:EDITOR = "vim"
    E:LC_ALL = "en_US.UTF-8"
#+END_SRC

I use Vagrant from a [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/30952][Nix package]] that builds it from source, which
works fine but prints by default a warning about Vagrant not running
from an official installed. The following environment variable gets
rid of the warning.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
  E:VAGRANT_INSTALLER_ENV = 1
#+END_SRC

Function to shorten a string to a maximum length, followed by dots.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    fn dotify_string [str dotify_length]{
      if (or (== $dotify_length 0) (<= (count $str) $dotify_length)) {
        put $str
      } else {
        re:replace '(.{'$dotify_length'}).*' '$1…' $str
      }
    }
#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/elves/elvish/issues/500][Parallel redirection of stdout and stderr to different commands]]. The
=pipesplit= function takes three lambdas. The first one is executed,
its stdout is redirected to the second one, and its stderr to the
third one.

#+BEGIN_SRC elvish
    fn pipesplit [l1 l2 l3]{
      pout = (pipe)
      perr = (pipe)
      run-parallel {
        $l1 > $pout 2> $perr
        pwclose $pout
        pwclose $perr
      } {
        $l2 < $pout
        prclose $pout
      } {
        $l3 < $perr
        prclose $perr
      }
    }
#+END_SRC

Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > pipesplit { echo stdout-test; echo stderr-test >&2 } { echo STDOUT: (cat) } { echo STDERR: (cat) }
  STDOUT: stdout-test
  STDERR: stderr-test
#+END_EXAMPLE
