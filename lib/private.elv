  var slipsum = "Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried
  chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a
  transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But
  I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've
  already been through too much shit this morning over this case to
  hand it over to your dumb ass. Well, the way they make shows is,
  they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that
  show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one
  show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots
  get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
  nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. The
  path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
  the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
  name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
  of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
  lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
  and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
  brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My
  vengeance upon thee. Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see
  a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on
  it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his
  face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you
  put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
  store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here
  shopping for an infant named Jeb. Your bones don't break, mine
  do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses
  differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also
  clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to
  water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs,
  we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
  I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. Now that we know
  who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense!
  In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going
  to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
  friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You
  know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. You
  think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
  mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
  murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
  don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
  seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
  took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
  snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
  it doesn't hold a candle to man. Look, just because I don't be
  givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to
  throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way
  the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
  paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm
  sayin'? Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South
  Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American
  crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little
  book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American
  crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. My money's in that
  office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't
  there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot
  you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in
  the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me
  too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You
  listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in
  there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?"
